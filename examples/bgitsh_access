# bgitsh access file
#
# Format:
# 
# username reponame,perms [reponame,perms ...]
#
# Repo names can be regular expressions.
#
# Permissions are:
#
#   r   pull access
#   w   push access
#   rw  pull and push access
#   z   no access
#
# Repo names are tested in left to right order until the first match is
# made.  If no rules match, no access permission is granted.
#
# Examples:
#
# Allow read on repo1, read/write on repo2:
#
#   joeuser repo1,r repo2,rw
#
# Allow read on all repos, except the secret repo:
#
#   joeuser secret_repo,z .*,r
#
# Allow full access to all repos named "clientX_something", and nothing else:
#
#   joeuser clientX_.*,rw
#
